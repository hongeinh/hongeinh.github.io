# Create a simple Two-Factor Authentication application with Python Flask, MySQL, Docker and Twilio
For this quarter (Fall 2023?24? - I'm still so lost about this lol), one class requires students to set up an authentication system with Multi-Factor Authentication. 

I was like, cool, I always wanted to see how I can use Google Authenticator for my app, this would be a great opportunity.  
But guess what, the instructor said we need to build everything FROM SCRATCH. Okay interesting challenge, so here is a post of how I created a very simple website with the fundamental features (register, log in, log out, change information) with Twilio sandbox.

## Set up project template

## Design 

## Code up

## Testing

## Quality Check

## Containerization

## CI/CD and deploy
